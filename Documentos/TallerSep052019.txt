Difficulty level: +, ++, +++, ++++, +++++


1. There are four different points on a plane: A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), C(x3, y3) and D(x4, y4). 
Write a C++ program to check whether two straight lines AB and CD are orthogonal or not. ++

2. Write a C++ program to compute the sum of the specified number of Prime numbers.
For example when n = 7,
s = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 = 58. ++

3. Write a C++ program which prints three highest numbers from a list of numbers in descending order. +

5. Write a Python program to swap first and last digits of any number. +

6. Write a program in C++ to find the factorial of a number. +

7. Write a program in C++ to calculate the series (1) + (1+2) + (1+2+3) + (1+2+3+4) + ... + (1+2+3+4+...+n). +

8. Write a program in C++ to print a square pattern with # character. +

9. Write a program in C++ to print a rectangular pattern with # character. +

10. Write a program in C++ to display the n terms of even natural number and their sum. +

11. Write a program in C++ to find the frequency of each digit in a given integer. ++

12. Write a program in C++ that converts hexadecimal to decimal numbers. +++

13. Write a program in C++ that given the position of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other. ++++

14. Write a code in C++ that calculate the evolution of a particle that moves inside a cube of rigid walls. +++++

15 Write a code in C++ that calculates the number of particles of three types of gases interacting among them as the system evolves. Follow some rules: when a particle from gas 1 interacts with a particle of gas 2 they convert into two particles of gas type 3, when a particle from gas 1 interacts with a particle of gas 3 they convert into two particles of gas type 2, when a particle from gas 2 interacts with a particle of gas 3 they convert into two particles of gas type 1. +++++
